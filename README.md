# Installation 

just extract the files into your trollegle clone and compile normally.

Run: $ `java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 anon.trollegle.ExtendedCaptchaMulti`

or compile with: $ `javac -d [directory of trollegle clone] -encoding utf-8 [directory of extension clone]/*.java`

I want this project to be a public endeavour, so feel free to make a pull request ^^

Since `/.addcommand` is so expressive now, a lot of commands could be added with only it (without Java), so I'll add a `.rcmulti` multi file to this repository for useful commands.

The best way to learn about the commands, esp. the Query Commands, is reading the comments around them in `ExtendedAdminCommands.java`
Usage of the commands and examples is given there.
